# disk-filltest - Simple Tool to Detect Bad Disks by Filling with Random Data #

version 0.8.0W, 20171129 by https://github.com/Maaciej, based on version 0.7.1
see original README at https://github.com/bingmann/disk-filltest/blob/master/README

"W" stands for Windows, I think that the "consoleColor" procedure 
(allows to change color of text) will not compile and will not work 
on Linux and probably any other POSIX-compatible system.

What's new:

Fixes
-with so big disks there should be big files tested, but with big files (>4GB) there
were incorect raports of write/read speeds: fixed
-there was error in testing loop, after first detected error random block avery other test block
was reported as wrong. Now every incorrect random block is reported

New features
-easy filling and later testing
-Option to fill disk up to the last free sector
-Option for summary of all test with time taken and whole average speed
-summary of errors found
-differentiation of MB and MiB in output
-formating of output changed
-colorful output available


Known problems
-with "-z" option when test file size is bigger then biggest allowed file size of file system
(50 GB files on FAT pendrive with biggest allowed file equal to 4GB) program detect it as
a disk full for 1 MB block and start to fill rest with smaller test blocks 
( example: 8 MB) - it is really slow.
